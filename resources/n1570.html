</a>
<a name='FOREWORD.p1'>
<pre>1   ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (the International
    Electrotechnical Commission) form the specialized system for worldwide
    standardization. National bodies that are member of ISO or IEC participate in the
    development of International Standards through technical committees established by the
    respective organization to deal with particular fields of technical activity. ISO and IEC
    technical committees collaborate in fields of mutual interest. Other international
    organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO and IEC, also
    take part in the work.
</pre>
</a>
<a name='FOREWORD.p2'>
<pre>2   International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC
    Directives, Part 2. This International Standard was drafted in accordance with the fifth
    edition (2004).
</pre>
</a>
<a name='FOREWORD.p3'>
<pre>3   In the field of information technology, ISO and IEC have established a joint technical
    committee, ISO/IEC JTC 1. Draft International Standards adopted by the joint technical
    committee are circulated to national bodies for voting. Publication as an International
    Standard requires approval by at least 75% of the national bodies casting a vote.
</pre>

<pre>4   Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be
    the subject of patent rights. ISO and IEC shall not be held responsible for identifying any
    or all such patent rights.

<a name='FOREWORD.p5'>
<pre>5   This International Standard was prepared by Joint Technical Committee ISO/IEC JTC 1,
    Information technology , Subcommittee SC 22, Programming languages, their
    environments and system software interfaces. The Working Group responsible for this
    standard (WG 14) maintains a site on the World Wide Web at http://www.open-
    std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/ containing additional information relevant to this
    standard such as a Rationale for many of the decisions made during its preparation and a
    log of Defect Reports and Responses.

<a name='INTRODUCTION.p1'>
<pre>1   With the introduction of new devices and extended character sets, new features may be
    added to this International Standard. Subclauses in the language and library clauses warn
    implementors and programmers of usages which, though valid in themselves, may
    conflict with future additions.
</pre>
</a>
<a name='INTRODUCTION.p2'>
<pre>2   Certain features are obsolescent , which means that they may be considered for
    withdrawal in future revisions of this International Standard. They are retained because
    of their widespread use, but their use in new implementations (for implementation
    features) or new programs (for language [6.11] or library features [7.31]) is discouraged.
</pre>
</a>
<a name='INTRODUCTION.p3'>
<pre>3   This International Standard is divided into four major subdivisions:
    -- preliminary elements (clauses 1-4);
    -- the characteristics of environments that translate and execute C programs (clause 5);
    -- the language syntax, constraints, and semantics (clause 6);
    -- the library facilities (clause 7).
</pre>
</a>
<a name='INTRODUCTION.p4'>
<pre>4   Examples are provided to illustrate possible forms of the constructions described.
    Footnotes are provided to emphasize consequences of the rules described in that
    subclause or elsewhere in this International Standard. References are used to refer to
    other related subclauses. Recommendations are provided to give advice or guidance to
    implementors. Annexes provide additional information and summarize the information
    contained in this International Standard. A bibliography lists documents that were
    referred to during the preparation of the standard.

<pre>5   The language clause (clause 6) is derived from ``The C Reference Manual&#39;&#39;.
</pre>
</a>
<a name='INTRODUCTION.p6'>
<pre>6   The library clause (clause 7) is based on the 1984 /usr/group Standard .

<h3>5.1.1.2 [Translation phases]</h3>
<pre></pre>
</a>
<a name='5.1.1.2p1'>
<pre>1   The precedence among the syntax rules of translation is specified by the following
    phases.6)
         1.   Physical source file multibyte characters are mapped, in an implementation-
              defined manner, to the source character set (introducing new-line characters for
              end-of-line indicators) if necessary. Trigraph sequences are replaced by
              corresponding single-character internal representations.

     2.   Each instance of a backslash character (\) immediately followed by a new-line
          character is deleted, splicing physical source lines to form logical source lines.
          Only the last backslash on any physical source line shall be eligible for being part
          of such a splice. A source file that is not empty shall end in a new-line character,
          which shall not be immediately preceded by a backslash character before any such
          splicing takes place.
     3.   The source file is decomposed into preprocessing tokens7) and sequences of
          white-space characters (including comments). A source file shall not end in a
          partial preprocessing token or in a partial comment. Each comment is replaced by
          one space character. New-line characters are retained. Whether each nonempty
          sequence of white-space characters other than new-line is retained or replaced by
          one space character is implementation-defined.
     4. Preprocessing directives are executed, macro invocations are expanded, and
        _Pragma unary operator expressions are executed. If a character sequence that
        matches the syntax of a universal character name is produced by token
        concatenation (6.10.3.3), the behavior is undefined. A #include preprocessing
        directive causes the named header or source file to be processed from phase 1
        through phase 4, recursively. All preprocessing directives are then deleted.
     5. Each source character set member and escape sequence in character constants and
        string literals is converted to the corresponding member of the execution character
        set; if there is no corresponding member, it is converted to an implementation-
        defined member other than the null (wide) character.8)
     6.   Adjacent string literal tokens are concatenated.
     7. White-space characters separating tokens are no longer significant. Each
        preprocessing token is converted into a token. The resulting tokens are
        syntactically and semantically analyzed and translated as a translation unit.
     8.   All external object and function references are resolved. Library components are
          linked to satisfy external references to functions and objects not defined in the
          current translation. All such translator output is collected into a program image
          which contains information needed for execution in its execution environment.

     the expression statement behaves exactly the same as

     due to the associativity and precedence of these operators. Thus, the result of the sum (a + 32760) is

<pre>1   An identifier can denote an object; a function; a tag or a member of a structure, union, or
    enumeration; a typedef name; a label name; a macro name; or a macro parameter. The
    same identifier can denote different entities at different points in the program. A member
    of an enumeration is called an enumeration constant . Macro names and macro
    parameters are not considered further here, because prior to the semantic phase of
    program translation any occurrences of macro names in the source file are replaced by the
    preprocessing token sequences that constitute their macro definitions.
</pre>
</a>
<a name='6.2.1p2'>
<pre>2   For each different entity that an identifier designates, the identifier is visible (i.e., can be
    used) only within a region of program text called its scope. Different entities designated
    by the same identifier either have different scopes, or are in different name spaces. There
    are four kinds of scopes: function, file, block, and function prototype. (A function
    prototype is a declaration of a function that declares the types of its parameters.)
</pre>
</a>
<a name='6.2.1p3'>
<pre>3   A label name is the only kind of identifier that has function scope. It can be used (in a
    goto statement) anywhere in the function in which it appears, and is declared implicitly
    by its syntactic appearance (followed by a : and a statement).
</pre>
</a>
<a name='6.2.1p4'>
<pre>4   Every other identifier has scope determined by the placement of its declaration (in a
    declarator or type specifier). If the declarator or type specifier that declares the identifier
    appears outside of any block or list of parameters, the identifier has file scope, which
    terminates at the end of the translation unit. If the declarator or type specifier that
    declares the identifier appears inside a block or within the list of parameter declarations in
    a function definition, the identifier has block scope, which terminates at the end of the
    associated block. If the declarator or type specifier that declares the identifier appears

    within the list of parameter declarations in a function prototype (not part of a function
    definition), the identifier has function prototype scope, which terminates at the end of the
    function declarator. If an identifier designates two different entities in the same name
    space, the scopes might overlap. If so, the scope of one entity (the inner scope) will end
    strictly before the scope of the other entity (the outer scope). Within the inner scope, the
    identifier designates the entity declared in the inner scope; the entity declared in the outer
    scope is hidden (and not visible) within the inner scope.
</pre>
</a>
<a name='6.2.1p5'>
<pre>5   Unless explicitly stated otherwise, where this International Standard uses the term
    ``identifier&#39;&#39; to refer to some entity (as opposed to the syntactic construct), it refers to the
    entity in the relevant name space whose declaration is visible at the point the identifier
    occurs.
</pre>
</a>
<a name='6.2.1p6'>
<pre>6   Two identifiers have the same scope if and only if their scopes terminate at the same
    point.
</pre>
</a>
<a name='6.2.1p7'>
<pre>7   Structure, union, and enumeration tags have scope that begins just after the appearance of
    the tag in a type specifier that declares the tag. Each enumeration constant has scope that
    begins just after the appearance of its defining enumerator in an enumerator list. Any
    other identifier has scope that begins just after the completion of its declarator.
</pre>
</a>
<a name='6.2.1p8'>

<pre>5   In translation phase 6, the multibyte character sequences specified by any sequence of

    resulting multibyte character sequence is treated as having the same prefix; otherwise, it
    is treated as a character string literal. Whether differently-prefixed wide string literal

    sufficient to contain the sequence. For character string literals, the array elements have
    type char, and are initialized with the individual bytes of the multibyte character
    sequence. For UTF-8 string literals, the array elements have type char, and are
    initialized with the characters of the multibyte character sequence, as encoded in UTF-8.
    For wide string literals prefixed by the letter L, the array elements have type wchar_t
    and are initialized with the sequence of wide characters corresponding to the multibyte
    character sequence, as defined by the mbstowcs function with an implementation-
    defined current locale. For wide string literals prefixed by the letter u or U, the array
    elements have type char16_t or char32_t, respectively, and are initialized with the
    sequence of wide characters corresponding to the multibyte character sequence, as
    defined by successive calls to the mbrtoc16, or mbrtoc32 function as appropriate for
    its type, with an implementation-defined current locale. The value of a string literal

<pre>2   A postfix expression followed by an expression in square brackets [] is a subscripted
    designation of an element of an array object. The definition of the subscript operator []
    is that E1[E2] is identical to (*((E1)+(E2))). Because of the conversion rules that
    apply to the binary + operator, if E1 is an array object (equivalently, a pointer to the
    initial element of an array object) and E2 is an integer, E1[E2] designates the E2-th
    element of E1 (counting from zero).

<pre>3   Successive subscript operators designate an element of a multidimensional array object.
    If E is an n-dimensional array ( n  2) with dimensions i &times; j &times; . . . &times; k , then E (used as
    other than an lvalue) is converted to a pointer to an ( n - 1)-dimensional array with
    dimensions j &times; . . . &times; k . If the unary * operator is applied to this pointer explicitly, or
    implicitly as a result of subscripting, the result is the referenced ( n - 1)-dimensional
    array, which itself is converted into a pointer if used as other than an lvalue. It follows

    array of five ints. In the expression x[i], which is equivalent to (*((x)+(i))), x is first converted to
    a pointer to the initial array of five ints. Then i is adjusted according to the type of x, which conceptually
    entails multiplying i by the size of the object to which the pointer points, namely an array of five int
    objects. The results are added and indirection is applied to yield an array of five ints. When used in the
    expression x[i][j], that array is in turn converted to a pointer to the first of the ints, so x[i][j]
    yields an int.

<a name='FOOTNOTE.137'>
<pre><i><b>Footnote 137)</b> In other words, E depends on the value of P itself rather than on the value of an object referenced

<pre>9    The benefit of the restrict qualifiers is that they enable a translator to make an effective dependence
     analysis of function f without examining any of the calls of f in the program. The cost is that the
     programmer has to examine all of those calls to ensure that none give undefined behavior. For example, the

     both p and q.

<pre>3   In a declaration whose storage-class specifier is typedef, each declarator defines an
    identifier to be a typedef name that denotes the type specified for the identifier in the way
    described in 6.7.6. Any array size expressions associated with variable length array
    declarators are evaluated each time the declaration of the typedef name is reached in the
    order of execution. A typedef declaration does not introduce a new type, only a
    synonym for the type so specified. That is, in the following declarations:
             typedef T type_ident;
             type_ident D;
    type_ident is defined as a typedef name with the type specified by the declaration
    specifiers in T (known as T ), and the identifier in D has the type `` derived-declarator-
    type-list T &#39;&#39; where the derived-declarator-type-list is specified by the declarators of D. A

    after white space containing no new-line characters) or that follows white space
    containing at least one new-line character. The last token in the sequence is the first new-

<pre>2   If the name of the macro being replaced is found during this scan of the replacement list

    Furthermore, if any nested replacements encounter the name of the macro being replaced,
    it is not replaced. These nonreplaced macro name preprocessing tokens are no longer
    available for further replacement even if they are later (re)examined in contexts in which
    that macro name preprocessing token would otherwise have been replaced.

<pre>1   Each of the following statements applies unless explicitly stated otherwise in the detailed
    descriptions that follow: If an argument to a function has an invalid value (such as a value
    outside the domain of the function, or a pointer outside the address space of the program,
    or a null pointer, or a pointer to non-modifiable storage when the corresponding
    parameter is not const-qualified) or a type (after promotion) not expected by a function
    with variable number of arguments, the behavior is undefined. If a function argument is
    described as being an array, the pointer actually passed to the function shall have a value
    such that all address computations and accesses to objects (that would be valid if the
    pointer did point to the first element of such an array) are in fact valid. Any function
    declared in a header may be additionally implemented as a function-like macro defined in
    the header, so if a library function is declared explicitly when its header is included, one
    of the techniques shown below can be used to ensure the declaration is not affected by
    such a macro. Any macro definition of a function can be suppressed locally by enclosing
    the name of the function in parentheses, because the name is then not followed by the left
    parenthesis that indicates expansion of a macro function name. For the same syntactic
    reason, it is permitted to take the address of a library function even if it is also defined as
    a macro.185) The use of #undef to remove any macro definition will also ensure that an
    actual function is referred to. Any invocation of a library function that is implemented as
    a macro shall expand to code that evaluates each of its arguments exactly once, fully
    protected by parentheses where necessary, so it is generally safe to use arbitrary
    expressions as arguments.186) Likewise, those function-like macros described in the
    following subclauses may be invoked in an expression anywhere a function with a
    compatible return type could be called.187) All object-like macros listed as expanding to

    integer constant expressions shall additionally be suitable for use in #if preprocessing

                  #define abs(x) _BUILTIN_abs(x)

<h3>7.3.3 [Branch cuts]</h3>
<pre></pre>
</a>
<a name='7.3.3p1'>
<pre>1   Some of the functions below have branch cuts, across which the function is
    discontinuous. For implementations with a signed zero (including all IEC 60559
    implementations) that follow the specifications of annex G, the sign of zero distinguishes
    one side of a cut from another so the function is continuous (except for format
    limitations) as the cut is approached from either side. For example, for the square root
    function, which has a branch cut along the negative real axis, the top of the cut, with
    imaginary part +0, maps to the positive imaginary axis, and the bottom of the cut, with
    imaginary part -0, maps to the negative imaginary axis.
</pre>
</a>
<a name='7.3.3p2'>
<pre>2   Implementations that do not support a signed zero (see annex F) cannot distinguish the
    sides of branch cuts. These implementations shall map a cut so the function is continuous
    as the cut is approached coming around the finite endpoint of the cut in a counter
    clockwise direction. (Branch cuts for the functions specified here have just one finite
    endpoint.) For example, for the square root function, coming counter clockwise around
    the finite endpoint of the cut along the negative real axis approaches the cut from above,
    so the cut maps to the positive imaginary axis.

    Description
</pre>
</a>
<a name='7.3.4p2'>
<pre>2   The usual mathematical formulas for complex multiply, divide, and absolute value are
    problematic because of their treatment of infinities and because of undue overflow and
    underflow. The CX_LIMITED_RANGE pragma can be used to inform the
    implementation that (where the state is ``on&#39;&#39;) the usual mathematical formulas are
    acceptable.195) The pragma can occur either outside external declarations or preceding all
    explicit declarations and statements inside a compound statement. When outside external
    declarations, the pragma takes effect from its occurrence until another
    CX_LIMITED_RANGE pragma is encountered, or until the end of the translation unit.
    When inside a compound statement, the pragma takes effect from its occurrence until
    another CX_LIMITED_RANGE pragma is encountered (including within a nested
    compound statement), or until the end of the compound statement; at the end of a
    compound statement the state for the pragma is restored to its condition just before the

    compound statement. If this pragma is used in any other context, the behavior is
    undefined. The default state for the pragma is ``off&#39;&#39;.
</pre>
</a>
<a name='FOOTNOTE.195'>
<pre><i><b>Footnote 195)</b> The purpose of the pragma is to allow the implementation to use the formulas:
             ( x + iy ) &times; (u + iv ) = ( xu - yv ) + i ( yu + xv )
             ( x + iy ) / (u + iv ) = [( xu + yv ) + i ( yu - xv )]/(u2 + v 2 )
             | x + iy | =  x 2 + y2

</a>
<a name='7.6.1p2'>
<pre>2    The FENV_ACCESS pragma provides a means to inform the implementation when a
     program might access the floating-point environment to test floating-point status flags or
     run under non-default floating-point control modes.213) The pragma shall occur either
     outside external declarations or preceding all explicit declarations and statements inside a
     compound statement. When outside external declarations, the pragma takes effect from
     its occurrence until another FENV_ACCESS pragma is encountered, or until the end of
     the translation unit. When inside a compound statement, the pragma takes effect from its
     occurrence until another FENV_ACCESS pragma is encountered (including within a
     nested compound statement), or until the end of the compound statement; at the end of a
     compound statement the state for the pragma is restored to its condition just before the
     compound statement. If this pragma is used in any other context, the behavior is
     undefined. If part of a program tests floating-point status flags, sets floating-point control
     modes, or runs under non-default mode settings, but was translated with the state for the
     FENV_ACCESS pragma ``off&#39;&#39;, the behavior is undefined. The default state (``on&#39;&#39; or
     ``off&#39;&#39;) for the pragma is implementation-defined. (When execution passes from a part of
     the program translated with FENV_ACCESS ``off&#39;&#39; to a part translated with
     FENV_ACCESS ``on&#39;&#39;, the state of the floating-point status flags is unspecified and the
     floating-point control modes have their default settings.)

          folding). In general, if the state of FENV_ACCESS is ``off&#39;&#39;, the translator can assume that default

    approached in the limit (for example, log(0.0)). The description of each function lists
    any required pole errors; an implementation may define additional pole errors, provided
    that such errors are consistent with the mathematical definition of the function. On a pole
    error, the function returns an implementation-defined value; if the integer expression

    either outside external declarations or preceding all explicit declarations and statements
    inside a compound statement. When outside external declarations, the pragma takes
    effect from its occurrence until another FP_CONTRACT pragma is encountered, or until
    the end of the translation unit. When inside a compound statement, the pragma takes
    effect from its occurrence until another FP_CONTRACT pragma is encountered
    (including within a nested compound statement), or until the end of the compound

<pre>1   A stream is associated with an external file (which may be a physical device) by opening
    a file, which may involve creating a new file. Creating an existing file causes its former
    contents to be discarded, if necessary. If a file can support positioning requests (such as a
    disk file, as opposed to a terminal), then a file position indicator associated with the
    stream is positioned at the start (character number zero) of the file, unless the file is
    opened with append mode in which case it is implementation-defined whether the file
    position indicator is initially positioned at the beginning or the end of the file. The file
    position indicator is maintained by subsequent reads, writes, and positioning requests, to
    facilitate an orderly progression through the file.

    characters are intended to be transmitted to or from the host environment as a block when
    a buffer is filled. When a stream is line buffered , characters are intended to be
    transmitted to or from the host environment as a block when a new-line character is
    encountered. Furthermore, characters are intended to be transmitted as a block to the host
    environment when a buffer is filled, when input is requested on an unbuffered stream, or
    when input is requested on a line buffered stream that requires the transmission of

    #        The result is converted to an ``alternative form&#39;&#39;. For o conversion, it increases

<pre>8   The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
    d,i           The int argument is converted to signed decimal in the style [-]dddd. The
                  precision specifies the minimum number of digits to appear; if the value
                  being converted can be represented in fewer digits, it is expanded with
                  leading zeros. The default precision is 1. The result of converting a zero
                  value with a precision of zero is no characters.
    o,u,x,X The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned octal (o), unsigned
            decimal (u), or unsigned hexadecimal notation (x or X) in the style dddd ; the
            letters abcdef are used for x conversion and the letters ABCDEF for X
            conversion. The precision specifies the minimum number of digits to appear;
            if the value being converted can be represented in fewer digits, it is expanded
            with leading zeros. The default precision is 1. The result of converting a
            zero value with a precision of zero is no characters.
    f,F           A double argument representing a floating-point number is converted to
                  decimal notation in the style [-]ddd.ddd, where the number of digits after
                  the decimal-point character is equal to the precision specification. If the
                  precision is missing, it is taken as 6; if the precision is zero and the # flag is
                  not specified, no decimal-point character appears. If a decimal-point
                  character appears, at least one digit appears before it. The value is rounded to
                  the appropriate number of digits.
                  A double argument representing an infinity is converted in one of the styles
                  [-]inf or [-]infinity -- which style is implementation-defined. A
                  double argument representing a NaN is converted in one of the styles
                  [-]nan or [-]nan(n-char-sequence) -- which style, and the meaning of
                  any n-char-sequence, is implementation-defined. The F conversion specifier
                  produces INF, INFINITY, or NAN instead of inf, infinity, or nan,
                  respectively.277)
    e,E           A double argument representing a floating-point number is converted in the
                  style [-]d.ddd e&plusmn;dd, where there is one digit (which is nonzero if the
                  argument is nonzero) before the decimal-point character and the number of
                  digits after it is equal to the precision; if the precision is missing, it is taken as

                  6; if the precision is zero and the # flag is not specified, no decimal-point
                  character appears. The value is rounded to the appropriate number of digits.
                  The E conversion specifier produces a number with E instead of e
                  introducing the exponent. The exponent always contains at least two digits,
                  and only as many more digits as necessary to represent the exponent. If the
                  value is zero, the exponent is zero.
                  A double argument representing an infinity or NaN is converted in the style
                  of an f or F conversion specifier.
    g,G           A double argument representing a floating-point number is converted in
                  style f or e (or in style F or E in the case of a G conversion specifier),
                  depending on the value converted and the precision. Let P equal the
                  precision if nonzero, 6 if the precision is omitted, or 1 if the precision is zero.
                  Then, if a conversion with style E would have an exponent of X :
                  -- if P &gt; X  -4, the conversion is with style f (or F) and precision
                     P - ( X + 1).
                  -- otherwise, the conversion is with style e (or E) and precision P - 1.
                  Finally, unless the # flag is used, any trailing zeros are removed from the
                  fractional portion of the result and the decimal-point character is removed if
                  there is no fractional portion remaining.
                  A double argument representing an infinity or NaN is converted in the style
                  of an f or F conversion specifier.
    a,A           A double argument representing a floating-point number is converted in the
                  style [-]0xh.hhhh p&plusmn;d, where there is one hexadecimal digit (which is

                  otherwise unspecified) before the decimal-point character278) and the number

                  missing and FLT_RADIX is a power of 2, then the precision is sufficient for
                  an exact representation of the value; if the precision is missing and
                  FLT_RADIX is not a power of 2, then the precision is sufficient to

                  distinguish279) values of type double, except that trailing zeros may be
                  omitted; if the precision is zero and the # flag is not specified, no decimal-
                  point character appears. The letters abcdef are used for a conversion and
                  the letters ABCDEF for A conversion. The A conversion specifier produces a
                  number with X and P instead of x and p. The exponent always contains at
                  least one digit, and only as many more digits as necessary to represent the
                  decimal exponent of 2. If the value is zero, the exponent is zero.
                  A double argument representing an infinity or NaN is converted in the style
                  of an f or F conversion specifier.
    c             If no l length modifier is present, the int argument is converted to an
                  unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.
                  If an l length modifier is present, the wint_t argument is converted as if by
                  an ls conversion specification with no precision and an argument that points

                  (byte). If no precision is specified, the array shall contain a null wide
                  character. If a precision is specified, no more than that many bytes are

                    number of characters written to the output stream so far by this call to
                    fprintf. No argument is converted, but one is consumed. If the conversion
                    specification includes any flags, a field width, or a precision, the behavior is
                    undefined.

</a>
<a name='7.21.6.2p2'>
<pre>2   The fscanf function reads input from the stream pointed to by stream, under control
    of the string pointed to by format that specifies the admissible input sequences and how
    they are to be converted for assignment, using subsequent arguments as pointers to the
    objects to receive the converted input. If there are insufficient arguments for the format,
    the behavior is undefined. If the format is exhausted while arguments remain, the excess
    arguments are evaluated (as always) but are otherwise ignored.
</pre>
</a>
<a name='7.21.6.2p3'>
<pre>3   The format shall be a multibyte character sequence, beginning and ending in its initial
    shift state. The format is composed of zero or more directives: one or more white-space
    characters, an ordinary multibyte character (neither % nor a white-space character), or a
    conversion specification. Each conversion specification is introduced by the character %.
    After the %, the following appear in sequence:
    -- An optional assignment-suppressing character *.
    -- An optional decimal integer greater than zero that specifies the maximum field width
       (in characters).
    -- An optional length modifier that specifies the size of the receiving object.
    -- A conversion specifier character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied.
</pre>
</a>
<a name='7.21.6.2p4'>
<pre>4   The fscanf function executes each directive of the format in turn. When all directives
    have been executed, or if a directive fails (as detailed below), the function returns.
    Failures are described as input failures (due to the occurrence of an encoding error or the
    unavailability of input characters), or matching failures (due to inappropriate input).
</pre>
</a>
<a name='7.21.6.2p5'>
<pre>5   A directive composed of white-space character(s) is executed by reading input up to the
    first non-white-space character (which remains unread), or until no more characters can
    be read. The directive never fails.
</pre>
</a>
<a name='7.21.6.2p6'>
<pre>6   A directive that is an ordinary multibyte character is executed by reading the next
    characters of the stream. If any of those characters differ from the ones composing the
    directive, the directive fails and the differing and subsequent characters remain unread.
    Similarly, if end-of-file, an encoding error, or a read error prevents a character from being
    read, the directive fails.

     The first character, if any, after the input item remains unread. If the length of the input
     item is zero, the execution of the directive fails; this condition is a matching failure unless

                    bracket character is in the scanlist and the next following right bracket
                    character is the matching right bracket that ends the specification; otherwise
                    the first following right bracket character is the one that ends the
                    specification. If a - character is in the scanlist and is not the first, nor the
                    second where the first character is a ^, nor the last character, the behavior is
                    implementation-defined.
     p              Matches an implementation-defined set of sequences, which should be the
                    same as the set of sequences that may be produced by the %p conversion of
                    the fprintf function. The corresponding argument shall be a pointer to a
                    pointer to void. The input item is converted to a pointer value in an
                    implementation-defined manner. If the input item is a value converted earlier
                    during the same program execution, the pointer that results shall compare
                    equal to that value; otherwise the behavior of the %p conversion is undefined.
     n              No input is consumed. The corresponding argument shall be a pointer to
                    signed integer into which is to be written the number of characters read from
                    the input stream so far by this call to the fscanf function. Execution of a
                    %n directive does not increment the assignment count returned at the
                    completion of execution of the fscanf function. No argument is converted,
                    but one is consumed. If the conversion specification includes an assignment-
                    suppressing character or a field width, the behavior is undefined.
     %              Matches a single % character; no conversion or assignment occurs. The
                    complete conversion specification shall be %%.

<pre>1   The order and contiguity of storage allocated by successive calls to the
    aligned_alloc, calloc, malloc, and realloc functions is unspecified. The
    pointer returned if the allocation succeeds is suitably aligned so that it may be assigned to
    a pointer to any type of object with a fundamental alignment requirement and then used
    to access such an object or an array of such objects in the space allocated (until the space
    is explicitly deallocated). The lifetime of an allocated object extends from the allocation
    until the deallocation. Each such allocation shall yield a pointer to an object disjoint from
    any other object. The pointer returned points to the start (lowest byte address) of the
    allocated space. If the space cannot be allocated, a null pointer is returned. If the size of
    the space requested is zero, the behavior is implementation-defined: either a null pointer
    is returned, or the behavior is as if the size were some nonzero value, except that the
    returned pointer shall not be used to access an object.

    modify the storage that they allocate or deallocate. A call to free or realloc that
    deallocates a region p of memory synchronizes with any allocation call that allocates all
    or part of the region p. This synchronization occurs after any access of p by the
    deallocating function, and before any such access by the allocating function.

<pre>6   The flag wide characters and their meanings are:
    -        The result of the conversion is left-justified within the field. (It is right-justified if
             this flag is not specified.)
    +        The result of a signed conversion always begins with a plus or minus sign. (It
             begins with a sign only when a negative value is converted if this flag is not

              specified.)331)
    space If the first wide character of a signed conversion is not a sign, or if a signed
          conversion results in no wide characters, a space is prefixed to the result. If the
          space and + flags both appear, the space flag is ignored.
    #         The result is converted to an ``alternative form&#39;&#39;. For o conversion, it increases
              the precision, if and only if necessary, to force the first digit of the result to be a
              zero (if the value and precision are both 0, a single 0 is printed). For x (or X)
              conversion, a nonzero result has 0x (or 0X) prefixed to it. For a, A, e, E, f, F, g,
              and G conversions, the result of converting a floating-point number always
              contains a decimal-point wide character, even if no digits follow it. (Normally, a

    0         For d, i, o, u, x, X, a, A, e, E, f, F, g, and G conversions, leading zeros
              (following any indication of sign or base) are used to pad to the field width rather
              than performing space padding, except when converting an infinity or NaN. If the

<pre>8   The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
    d,i         The int argument is converted to signed decimal in the style [-]dddd. The
                precision specifies the minimum number of digits to appear; if the value
                being converted can be represented in fewer digits, it is expanded with
                leading zeros. The default precision is 1. The result of converting a zero
                value with a precision of zero is no wide characters.
        o,u,x,X The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned octal (o), unsigned
                decimal (u), or unsigned hexadecimal notation (x or X) in the style dddd ; the
                letters abcdef are used for x conversion and the letters ABCDEF for X
                conversion. The precision specifies the minimum number of digits to appear;
                if the value being converted can be represented in fewer digits, it is expanded
                with leading zeros. The default precision is 1. The result of converting a
                zero value with a precision of zero is no wide characters.

    f,F          A double argument representing a floating-point number is converted to
                 decimal notation in the style [-]ddd.ddd, where the number of digits after
                 the decimal-point wide character is equal to the precision specification. If the
                 precision is missing, it is taken as 6; if the precision is zero and the # flag is
                 not specified, no decimal-point wide character appears. If a decimal-point
                 wide character appears, at least one digit appears before it. The value is
                 rounded to the appropriate number of digits.
                 A double argument representing an infinity is converted in one of the styles
                 [-]inf or [-]infinity -- which style is implementation-defined. A
                 double argument representing a NaN is converted in one of the styles
                 [-]nan or [-]nan(n-wchar-sequence) -- which style, and the meaning of
                 any n-wchar-sequence, is implementation-defined. The F conversion
                 specifier produces INF, INFINITY, or NAN instead of inf, infinity, or
                 nan, respectively.332)
    e,E          A double argument representing a floating-point number is converted in the
                 style [-]d.ddd e&plusmn;dd, where there is one digit (which is nonzero if the
                 argument is nonzero) before the decimal-point wide character and the number
                 of digits after it is equal to the precision; if the precision is missing, it is taken
                 as 6; if the precision is zero and the # flag is not specified, no decimal-point
                 wide character appears. The value is rounded to the appropriate number of
                 digits. The E conversion specifier produces a number with E instead of e
                 introducing the exponent. The exponent always contains at least two digits,
                 and only as many more digits as necessary to represent the exponent. If the
                 value is zero, the exponent is zero.
                 A double argument representing an infinity or NaN is converted in the style
                 of an f or F conversion specifier.
    g,G          A double argument representing a floating-point number is converted in
                 style f or e (or in style F or E in the case of a G conversion specifier),
                 depending on the value converted and the precision. Let P equal the
                 precision if nonzero, 6 if the precision is omitted, or 1 if the precision is zero.
                 Then, if a conversion with style E would have an exponent of X :
                 -- if P &gt; X  -4, the conversion is with style f (or F) and precision
                    P - ( X + 1).
                 -- otherwise, the conversion is with style e (or E) and precision P - 1.
                 Finally, unless the # flag is used, any trailing zeros are removed from the

                 fractional portion of the result and the decimal-point wide character is
                 removed if there is no fractional portion remaining.
                 A double argument representing an infinity or NaN is converted in the style
                 of an f or F conversion specifier.
    a,A          A double argument representing a floating-point number is converted in the
                 style [-]0xh.hhhh p&plusmn;d, where there is one hexadecimal digit (which is
                 nonzero if the argument is a normalized floating-point number and is
                 otherwise unspecified) before the decimal-point wide character333) and the
                 number of hexadecimal digits after it is equal to the precision; if the precision
                 is missing and FLT_RADIX is a power of 2, then the precision is sufficient
                 for an exact representation of the value; if the precision is missing and
                 FLT_RADIX is not a power of 2, then the precision is sufficient to
                 distinguish334) values of type double, except that trailing zeros may be
                 omitted; if the precision is zero and the # flag is not specified, no decimal-
                 point wide character appears. The letters abcdef are used for a conversion
                 and the letters ABCDEF for A conversion. The A conversion specifier
                 produces a number with X and P instead of x and p. The exponent always
                 contains at least one digit, and only as many more digits as necessary to
                 represent the decimal exponent of 2. If the value is zero, the exponent is
                 zero.
                 A double argument representing an infinity or NaN is converted in the style
                 of an f or F conversion specifier.
    c            If no l length modifier is present, the int argument is converted to a wide
                 character as if by calling btowc and the resulting wide character is written.
                 If an l length modifier is present, the wint_t argument is converted to
                 wchar_t and written.
    s            If no l length modifier is present, the argument shall be a pointer to the initial
                 element of a character array containing a multibyte character sequence
                 beginning in the initial shift state. Characters from the array are converted as
                 if by repeated calls to the mbrtowc function, with the conversion state
                 described by an mbstate_t object initialized to zero before the first

<pre>2    The fwscanf function reads input from the stream pointed to by stream, under

     sequences and how they are to be converted for assignment, using subsequent arguments

    as pointers to the objects to receive the converted input. If there are insufficient
    arguments for the format, the behavior is undefined. If the format is exhausted while
    arguments remain, the excess arguments are evaluated (as always) but are otherwise
    ignored.

<pre>3   The format is composed of zero or more directives: one or more white-space wide
    characters, an ordinary wide character (neither % nor a white-space wide character), or a
    conversion specification. Each conversion specification is introduced by the wide
    character %. After the %, the following appear in sequence:
    -- An optional assignment-suppressing wide character *.
    -- An optional decimal integer greater than zero that specifies the maximum field width
       (in wide characters).
    -- An optional length modifier that specifies the size of the receiving object.

       applied.

<pre>4   The fwscanf function executes each directive of the format in turn. When all directives
    have been executed, or if a directive fails (as detailed below), the function returns.

<pre>1   This annex specifies C language support for the IEC 60559 floating-point standard. The
    IEC 60559 floating-point standard is specifically Binary floating-point arithmetic for
    microprocessor systems, second edition (IEC 60559:1989), previously designated
    IEC 559:1989 and as IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic
    (ANSI/IEEE 754-1985). IEEE Standard for Radix-Independent Floating-Point
    Arithmetic (ANSI/IEEE 854-1987) generalizes the binary standard to remove
    dependencies on radix and word length. IEC 60559 generally refers to the floating-point
    standard, as in IEC 60559 operation, IEC 60559 format, etc. An implementation that
    defines _ _STDC_IEC_559_ _ shall conform to the specifications in this annex.356)
    Where a binding between the C language and IEC 60559 is indicated, the
    IEC 60559-specified behavior is adopted by reference, unless stated otherwise. Since
    negative and positive infinity are representable in IEC 60559 formats, all real numbers lie
    within the range of representable values.

<h3>F.3 [Operators and functions]</h3>
<pre></pre>
</a>
<a name='F.3p1'>
<pre>1   C operators and functions provide IEC 60559 required and recommended facilities as
    listed below.
    -- The +, -, *, and / operators provide the IEC 60559 add, subtract, multiply, and
       divide operations.
    -- The sqrt functions in &lt;math.h&gt; provide the IEC 60559 square root operation.
    -- The remainder functions in &lt;math.h&gt; provide the IEC 60559 remainder
       operation. The remquo functions in &lt;math.h&gt; provide the same operation but
       with additional information.
    -- The rint functions in &lt;math.h&gt; provide the IEC 60559 operation that rounds a
       floating-point number to an integer value (in the same precision). The nearbyint
       functions in &lt;math.h&gt; provide the nearbyinteger function recommended in the
       Appendix to ANSI/IEEE 854.
    -- The conversions for floating types provide the IEC 60559 conversions between
       floating-point precisions.
    -- The conversions from integer to floating types provide the IEC 60559 conversions
       from integer to floating point.
    -- The conversions from floating to integer types provide IEC 60559-like conversions
       but always round toward zero.
    -- The lrint and llrint functions in &lt;math.h&gt; provide the IEC 60559
       conversions, which honor the directed rounding mode, from floating point to the
       long int and long long int integer formats. The lrint and llrint
       functions can be used to implement IEC 60559 conversions from floating to other
       integer formats.
    -- The translation time conversion of floating constants and the strtod, strtof,
       strtold, fprintf, fscanf, and related library functions in &lt;stdlib.h&gt;,

   &lt;stdio.h&gt;, and &lt;wchar.h&gt; provide IEC 60559 binary-decimal conversions. The
   strtold function in &lt;stdlib.h&gt; provides the conv function recommended in the
   Appendix to ANSI/IEEE 854.
-- The relational and equality operators provide IEC 60559 comparisons. IEC 60559
   identifies a need for additional comparison predicates to facilitate writing code that
   accounts for NaNs. The comparison macros (isgreater, isgreaterequal,
   isless, islessequal, islessgreater, and isunordered) in &lt;math.h&gt;
   supplement the language operators to address this need. The islessgreater and
   isunordered macros provide respectively a quiet version of the &lt;&gt; predicate and
   the unordered predicate recommended in the Appendix to IEC 60559.
-- The feclearexcept, feraiseexcept, and fetestexcept functions in
   &lt;fenv.h&gt; provide the facility to test and alter the IEC 60559 floating-point
   exception status flags. The fegetexceptflag and fesetexceptflag
   functions in &lt;fenv.h&gt; provide the facility to save and restore all five status flags at
   one time. These functions are used in conjunction with the type fexcept_t and the
   floating-point    exception      macros      (FE_INEXACT,         FE_DIVBYZERO,
   FE_UNDERFLOW, FE_OVERFLOW, FE_INVALID) also in &lt;fenv.h&gt;.
-- The fegetround and fesetround functions in &lt;fenv.h&gt; provide the facility
   to select among the IEC 60559 directed rounding modes represented by the rounding
   direction macros in &lt;fenv.h&gt; (FE_TONEAREST, FE_UPWARD, FE_DOWNWARD,
   FE_TOWARDZERO) and the values 0, 1, 2, and 3 of FLT_ROUNDS are the
   IEC 60559 directed rounding modes.
-- The fegetenv, feholdexcept, fesetenv, and feupdateenv functions in
   &lt;fenv.h&gt; provide a facility to manage the floating-point environment, comprising
   the IEC 60559 status flags and control modes.
-- The copysign functions in &lt;math.h&gt; provide the copysign function
   recommended in the Appendix to IEC 60559.
-- The fabs functions in &lt;math.h&gt; provide the abs function recommended in the
   Appendix to IEC 60559.
-- The unary minus (-) operator provides the unary minus (-) operation recommended
   in the Appendix to IEC 60559.
-- The scalbn and scalbln functions in &lt;math.h&gt; provide the scalb function
   recommended in the Appendix to IEC 60559.
-- The logb functions in &lt;math.h&gt; provide the logb function recommended in the
   Appendix to IEC 60559, but following the newer specifications in ANSI/IEEE 854.
-- The nextafter and nexttoward functions in &lt;math.h&gt; provide the nextafter
   function recommended in the Appendix to IEC 60559 (but with a minor change to

        better handle signed zeros).
    -- The isfinite macro in &lt;math.h&gt; provides the finite function recommended in
       the Appendix to IEC 60559.
    -- The isnan macro in &lt;math.h&gt; provides the isnan function recommended in the
       Appendix to IEC 60559.
    -- The signbit macro and the fpclassify macro in &lt;math.h&gt;, used in
       conjunction with the number classification macros (FP_NAN, FP_INFINITE,
       FP_NORMAL, FP_SUBNORMAL, FP_ZERO), provide the facility of the class
       function recommended in the Appendix to IEC 60559 (except that the classification
       macros defined in 7.12.3 do not distinguish signaling from quiet NaNs).

    of x and y entail execution-time conversion; however, in some expression evaluation methods, the
    conversions is not to a narrower format, in which case no floating-point exception is raised.367) The

    x + 1 might raise floating-point exceptions, so cannot be removed. And since the loop

    for multiplication. In the spirit of the multiplication example above, this code does not defend against

    (cast)ceil(x), or (cast)floor(x). In addition, C&#39;s floating-point to integer
    conversion functions, lrint(), llrint(), lround(), and llround(), can be
    used. They all meet LIA-1&#39;s requirements on floating to integer rounding for in-range

     65536.0 )) ? y : 65536.0 + y) will compute an integer value in the range 0.0
    to 65535.0 which can then be cast to unsigned short int. But, the
    remainder() function is not useful for doing silent wrapping to signed integer types,
    e.g., remainder( rint(x), 65536.0 ) will compute an integer value in the
    range -32767.0 to +32768.0 which is not, in general, in the range of signed short
    int.

</a>
<a name='K.1p1'>
<pre>1   Traditionally, the C Library has contained many functions that trust the programmer to
    provide output character arrays big enough to hold the result being produced. Not only
    do these functions not check that the arrays are big enough, they frequently lack the
    information needed to perform such checks. While it is possible to write safe, robust, and
    error-free code using the existing library, the library tends to promote programming styles
    that lead to mysterious failures if a result is too big for the provided array.
</pre>
</a>
<a name='K.1p2'>
<pre>2   A common programming style is to declare character arrays large enough to handle most
    practical cases. However, if these arrays are not large enough to handle the resulting
    strings, data can be written past the end of the array overwriting other data and program
    structures. The program never gets any indication that a problem exists, and so never has
    a chance to recover or to fail gracefully.
</pre>
</a>
<a name='K.1p3'>
<pre>3   Worse, this style of programming has compromised the security of computers and
    networks. Buffer overflows can often be exploited to run arbitrary code with the
    permissions of the vulnerable (defective) program.
</pre>
</a>
<a name='K.1p4'>
<pre>4   If the programmer writes runtime checks to verify lengths before calling library
    functions, then those runtime checks frequently duplicate work done inside the library
    functions, which discover string lengths as a side effect of doing their job.
</pre>
</a>
<a name='K.1p5'>
<pre>5   This annex provides alternative library functions that promote safer, more secure
    programming. The alternative functions verify that output buffers are large enough for
    the intended result and return a failure indicator if they are not. Data is never written past
    the end of an array. All string results are null terminated.
</pre>
</a>
<a name='K.1p6'>
<pre>6   This annex also addresses another problem that complicates writing robust code:
    functions that are not reentrant because they return pointers to static objects owned by the
    function. Such functions can be troublesome since a previously returned result can
    change if the function is called again, perhaps by another thread.

<pre>5   The mbsrtowcs_s function converts a sequence of multibyte characters that begins in
    the conversion state described by the object pointed to by ps, from the array indirectly
    pointed to by src into a sequence of corresponding wide characters. If dst is not a null
    pointer, the converted characters are stored into the array pointed to by dst. Conversion
    continues up to and including a terminating null character, which is also stored.
    Conversion stops earlier in two cases: when a sequence of bytes is encountered that does
    not form a valid multibyte character, or (if dst is not a null pointer) when len wide
     characters have been stored into the array pointed to by dst.453) If dst is not a null
     pointer and no null wide character was stored into the array pointed to by dst, then
     dst[len] is set to the null wide character. Each conversion takes place as if by a call

     null pointer, the converted characters are then stored into the array pointed to by dst.
     Conversion continues up to and including a terminating null wide character, which is also
     stored. Conversion stops earlier in two cases:
     -- when a wide character is reached that does not correspond to a valid multibyte
        character;
     -- (if dst is not a null pointer) when the next multibyte character would exceed the
         limit of n total bytes to be stored into the array pointed to by dst. If the wide
         character being converted is the null wide character, then n is the lesser of len or
         dstmax. Otherwise, n is the lesser of len or dstmax-1.
     If the conversion stops without converting a null wide character and dst is not a null
     pointer, then a null character is stored into the array pointed to by dst immediately
     following any multibyte characters already stored. Each conversion takes place as if by a
