### Problem 59: Construct height-balanced binary trees.

...aka. AVL trees.

Let's briefly analyse the AVL tree invariant for our nefarious purposes. We know from CS
homework that:

 * An AVL tree of height h has at least 2^((h/2)-1) nodes, a fact this problem and problem
   60 are unnecessarily vague about

 * The inductive step of the proof is as follows: An AVL tree of height `h >= 3` has two
   subtrees: one must be of height (h-1) and the other (h-2) (and not (h-3) because the
   tree is balanced). Therefore: n(h) = 1 + n(h-1) + n(h-2)

 * For problem 60, we will need to notice these are Fibonacci trees, and we know a
   Fibonacci tree of order N has F(N+2)-1 nodes, where F(N) is the N-th Fibonacci number


```haskell
data Tree a = Empty | Branch a (Tree a) (Tree a)
              deriving (Show, Eq)

hbal_tree v 0 = [(0, Empty)]
hbal_tree v 1 = [(1, Branch v Empty Empty)]
-- Just build trees which satisfy the invariant:
hbal_tree v n = let subtrees = hbal_tree v (n - 2) ++ hbal_tree v (n - 1)
                in [ (h, Branch v lb rb) | (lh, lb) <- subtrees, (rh, rb) <- subtrees
                                         , let h = 1 + max lh rh, h == n]

main = do print $ (map snd) $ hbal_tree 'x' 3
```

### Problem 60: Construct height-balanced binary trees with a given number of nodes.

```haskell
-- We start with our own datatype,
data Tree a = Empty | Branch a (Tree a) (Tree a)
              deriving (Show, Eq)

-- Let's define the Fibonacci sequence:
fib :: [Int]
fib = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fib (tail fib)

-- Like we proved 10 years ago, the minimum number of nodes in a height-balanced tree of
-- height h:
min_nodes h = fib !! (h + 2) - 1
-- and the maximum:
max_nodes h = 2^h - 1

-- Now, properties of height. A height-balanced tree of n nodes has minimum height:
min_height n = ceiling $ logBase 2 $ fromIntegral (n + 1)
-- and maximum height:
max_height n = length (takeWhile (<= n+1) fib) - 3

-- So now we can generate AVL trees:
hbal_tree_nodes x n = [t | h <- [min_height n .. max_height n], t <- balanced_tree h n]
    where
        balanced_tree 0 n = [Empty]
        balanced_tree 1 n = [Branch x Empty Empty]
        -- OK this list comprehension's tricky.
        -- We want all the trees with subtrees with heights that fit the balanced
        -- invariant (difference is less than 1). And, since we can calculate the number
        -- of nodes needed for those heights, we do so recursively:
        balanced_tree h n = [Branch x l r | (hl, hr) <- [ (h-2, h-1), (h-1, h-1), (h-1, h-2)]
                                          , let min_nl = max (min_nodes hl) (n - 1 - max_nodes hr)
                                          , let max_nl = min (max_nodes hl) (n - 1 - min_nodes hr)
                                          , nl <- [min_nl .. max_nl]
                                          , let nr = n - 1 - nl
                                          , l <- balanced_tree hl nl
                                          , r <- balanced_tree hr nr]

main = do print $ length $ hbal_tree_nodes 'x' 15
          mapM_ print $ map (hbal_tree_nodes 'x') [0..3]
          -- It seems to work, but is it correct?
```
