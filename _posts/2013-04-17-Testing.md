This is a test of Jekyll. If it works I'll move all my blogs to github.

TODO
====

* <strike>Posts don't seem to be interpreted as Markdown. Hmm.</strike>
* Include RSS feeds
* Add Disqus comments

Reference Material
==================

* http://cobyism.com/jekyll/docs/home/
* http://paulstamatiou.com/how-to-wordpress-to-jekyll
* http://spparker.com/posts/2011-04-26-keeping-jekyll-classy

Code highlighting test
======================

<strike>Can we</strike> We can highlight Erlang code:

{% highlight erlang %}
start([Config]) ->
    File = (atom_to_list(Config)),
    io:format("ws start:~p~n",[File]),
    Conf = read_config(File),
    start_link(Conf).
{% endhighlight %}

or Python:

{% highlight python %}
def phi(n):
    """Computes the Euler's totient function Ï†(n) -
    number of positive numbers less than or
    equal to n which are relatively prime to n."""
    from functools import reduce
    from operator  import mul
    return n * reduce(mul, [(1 - 1 / p) for p in prime_factors(n)], 1)
{% endhighlight %}


Quotes test
===========
Quotes seem to work properly. I can make &ldquo;curly quotes&rdquo; but not
``regular quotes''. Not a big deal for the time being.

Stuff that is broken
====================

* <strike>Autolinking</strike>
* For a static site, it seems I've managed to make it pretty slow.

Making Autolinking work
==========
To get autolinking to work, add to <b>_config.yml</b>:

    rdiscount:
        extensions: [smart, autolink]

Comments
========
Will use Disqus for this. It seems to work nicely in other blogs like [Joe Armstrong's](http://joearms.github.io/).
If anybody knows how to make a tweet link please add a comment. When possible. Of course.

Tests
=====
Page.title = ({{page.title}})
Page.url = ({{page.url}})
