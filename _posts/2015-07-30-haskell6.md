-- Problem 40: Goldbach's conjecture.
-- I hate Goldbach and his conjecture. That being said, since we have a sieve from problem
-- 39, we can use it. I wonder how fast this is compared to a solution involving trial
-- division, but I'm kinda stuck when trying to time stuff in GHCi (probably not the right
-- tool for the job, but I'm just starting out, so point me out to the right direction :):

goldbach n = head [ (p1, p2) | p1 <- primesR 2 (n - 2), let p2 = n - p1, isPrime p2]
    where
        factors a = filter (isFactor a) [2..a-1]
        isFactor a b = a `mod` b == 0
        isPrime a = null $ factors a

-- Problem 41: Given a range of integers by its lower and upper limit, print a list of all
-- even numbers and their Goldbach composition.
-- It surprised me to see that one of the solutions filters the even numbers from the
-- [n..m] range with `filter even`, but then uses `dropWhile` to filter out 2 - weird
-- inconsistency, I guess they were trying to showcase many functions:
goldbach_list n m = map goldbach $ filter (<4) $ filter even [n..m]

-- Problem 46:
