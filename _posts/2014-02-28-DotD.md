A few months ago, I wrote a parser to help me get the most out of my time spent with a
Flash game called "Dawn of the Dragons"
([link](http://armorgames.com/dawn-of-the-dragons-game/13509)). There was (is) another
collaborative method to calculate useful statistics about in-game items, but it involves
a lot more manual labour than I'm willing to put into them, so I created an automated
parser. Just copy / paste your raid logs into appropriate text file(s) and feed them to
this parser. For instance, `python dotd.py raid.log --name Ratman`, where "Ratman" is your
in-game character name.

You can find it [on GitHub](https://gist.github.com/mfukar/9269332). It requires Python 3.
