The fact there is almost zero software historiography means everything about it is doomed to
eternally be reinvented.
Professionals old enough to remember software in the early 2000s routinely bemoan the current state
of applications built upon a plethora of frameworks which all aim to be "generic" and "flexible" and
thus end up doing very few things effectively.
This situation has an analogue with traffic engineering constantly attempting to reinvent all sorts
of bicycle infrastructure that was studied in the 1960s [^1].
