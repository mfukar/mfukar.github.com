summary: Programming gems which are both stupid and useless
---
Welcome, neighbours, to a new series of posts. These posts will illustrate bits and pieces of code
which is both _stupid_ and _useless_. In other words, code which should be almost extinct, but for
reasons contrary to conscientious engineering practice, it survives.

Let's dive in to our first gem!

# The gem

    static const char directions[]  = "in\0out";

# Stupid

The gem is stupid because:

1. It violates common idioms on C string usage, like an array initialised by a single string
2. It creates unrealistic expectations from the rest of the code, particularly by standard library
   functions
3. It imposes unnecessary complexity for whoever wants to access the beginning of `"in"` or `"out"`

# Useless

The gem is useless because:

1. The same thing can be done in a more readable and idiomatic way by using an array of either 2
   arrays of `char` or 2 pointers to `char`
2. It leads to code like `&directions[flag == dir ? 0 : 3]` (actual code) everytime someone wants to
   access `"out"`
3. It does not save memory, and it's not faster than any other alternative

I hope this has been instructive. 'til next time!
