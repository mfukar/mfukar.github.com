There is a singular reason I skydive, one I'm thinking all people who do _extreme sports_
share. It's not adventure seeking, an adrenaline addiction, it's not an attempt to
overcome their limits, and it is not insanity.

It's trying to ascertain I'm not insane.

As long as I jump from that plane and keep going down, gravity, physics, and the world
still make sense.

Until one day I start going up, then promptly lose it and die.
