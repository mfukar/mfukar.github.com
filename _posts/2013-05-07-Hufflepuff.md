summary: Just a theory on Hufflepuff
---

After briefly delving into the Harry Potter books again, I have come up with the theory is
that Hufflepuff is basically, without being at all derogatory, a collective of stoners. I
find it difficult that I would be the first to come up with this theory, given that there
are plenty of indications in the books that support it.

Let us examine the evidence briefly:

+ Exhibit A: Most Hufflepuff mages are considered nice and peaceful, the house has indeed
  produced the fewest number of dark wizards.
+ Exhibit B: The entrance to their common room is right next to the kitchen, quoting ''_in
  a nook on the right hand side of the kitchen corridor_''. It is also described decorated
  with many ''_interesting plants_''.
+ Exhibit C: The head of house Hufflepuff teaches Herbology. Most Hufflepuff students also
  develop a particular interest in Herbology.
+ Exhibit D: A badger for an emblem sounds like exactly the kind of animal a stoner would
  come up with.
+ Exhibit E: The house name is somewhat suspect, possibly an attempt at self-deprecation.
  **Huff**-le-**puff**?
+ Exhibit F: Cedric Diggory seemed, and indeed acted, like he was high most of the time. I
  mean you have to have been high to think opening an egg inside of a bath was a good
  idea.
+ On a related but not directly linked note, Hufflepuffs are particularly good finders -
  it is not made clear if house membership somehow leads to or develops this aptitude.
  Likewise, it is undoubtedly certain that Slytherins prefer cocaine; I am studying the
  possibility that Gryffindors, with their reckless and fearless attitude, are fans of
  Adderall or a related substance.

That is all.
