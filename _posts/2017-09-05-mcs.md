summary: The MCS lock - what is it, and how is it useful?
---
In a previous [post](), we saw what ticket locks are, and how they are a useful building block in
order to build systems with some latency and/or fairness guarantees. We saw that the ticket lock
guarantees a FIFO ordering on incoming threads and prevents starvation with a relatively low latency
impact. However, the traffic generated per lock acquisition is linear to the number of threads
competing for the lock (???). In this post, we will see how the MCS lock addresses this last point.
