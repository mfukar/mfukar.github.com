### Problem 69: Dotstring representation of binary trees.

The first part of the problem is straightforward preorder traversal:

```haskell
tree2ds :: Tree Char -> String
tree2ds Empty = "."
tree2ds (Branch v l r) = v : tree2ds l ++ tree2ds r
```

For the second part, constructing a tree from a preorder sequence is unambiguous:

```haskell
ds2tree :: String -> (Tree Char, String)
ds2tree "" = (Empty, "")
ds2tree ( c : cs )
    | c == '.' = (Empty, cs)
    | otherwise = (Branch c l r, rrest)
    where (l, lrest) = ds2tree cs
          (r, rrest) = ds2tree lrest

```

# Problem 70: Count the nodes of a multiway tree.

Oooh, multiway trees, neat!

```haskell
nnodes :: Tree a -> Int
nnodes (Node _ ts) = 1 + sum ( map nnodes ts )
```

and to construct a multiway tree from a node string, & vice versa:

```haskell

```
