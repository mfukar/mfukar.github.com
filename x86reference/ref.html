<p>This is (will be) an unofficial online version of the Intel IA-32 and Intel 64
instruction set reference. Differences with the amd64 specification will be noted where
applicable.</p>

<p><b>This page is incomplete</b> (<i>obviously</i>). You can be patient and wait, or throw cash
or a six-pack of beer my way and I will put some more hours into it.</p>
